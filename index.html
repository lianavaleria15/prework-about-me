      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I originally studied computing science during A levels, but at that time it didn't appeal to 
        me to work in the industry, so instead I studied Psychology in my undergraduate. A requirement for my course was statistical analysis, which made me 
        refall in love with coding. What attracts me about web developement is the ability to use both my coding skills and my creative side.
